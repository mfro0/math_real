GHDL math_real implementation with native C functions (vastly improving accuracy compared to IEEE standard implementation).

Copy to your work area and use `work.math_real.all` instead of `ieee.math_real.all` or - if you want to replace the standard implementation -
copy to the library directory of your ghdl installation. Do not forget to analyze there.
